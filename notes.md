IDEAs:
1. we have a home dashboard
    - there we have button for different tools
        - panic mode 
        - eureka mode 
2. we can have an idea data base 
3. we have a page for each tool where you can do multiple things
    - make an intant 
    - archive 
    - etc.
4. each tool has it's own page but in the dashboard you can do quick action and see stuff
